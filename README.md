## Git Work Process
There is a specific work process we follow when making changes to code. This process helps ensure that changes are made in a specific way and are tracked to allow for build and deploy to be seamless, the following is a summary of the work process

1. Since we are not tracking work items skip this ~~Find/Create a work item related to the work you are about to start~~ 
2. Create a new feature branch referencing the work item using all lowercase and a hyphen instead of spaces for the branch name
3. Clone the branch locally
4. Perform changes
5. Commit changes with proper comments indicating what was done ~~and always use #<WorkItemNumber> to reference the related work item~~
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have completed the work
7. Sync code to your feature branch on the server as often as you would like but Ideally should be a minimum of once a day.
